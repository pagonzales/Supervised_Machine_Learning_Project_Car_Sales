# Supervised Machine Learning Project (Car Sales Mathematical Modelling)
## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model (specifically linear regression) to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as mileage, engine volume, and year of manufacture. The goal includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and transformation to meet the assumptions of linear regression and ultimately derive insights about car pricing.
